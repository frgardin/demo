# Demo Project

## Introduction

This project is study purpose, I am doing Spring Specialization [Coursera](https://cousera.org/) courses:

- [Spring EcoSystem and Core](https://www.coursera.org/learn/spring-ecosystem-and-core/lecture/m75j8/spring-specialization)

- [Spring MVC, Spring Boot and RestControllers](https://www.coursera.org/programs/software-development-a5uds/learn/spring-mvc-rest-controller)

- [Spring Data Repositories](https://www.coursera.org/programs/software-development-a5uds/learn/spring-repositories)

- [Spring Cloud Overview](https://www.coursera.org/programs/software-development-a5uds/learn/spring-cloud-overview)

I will register my progress here, and I will combine the knoledge already got in the book [Spring Boot Up & Running](https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Boot-Running-Building-Applications/dp/1492076988) from Mark Heckler, and the knowledge gained in the Alura courses of Spring Boot and Java.

Furthermore, I am trying to use vscode instead of Intellij, just to learn use another IDE.
